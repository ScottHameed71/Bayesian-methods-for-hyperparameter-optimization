# Bayesian methods for hyperparameter optimization
Leverage Bayessian methods to select optimal hyperparameters for Machine Learning algorithms. Leveraging BayesianOptimization library https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization for this project. Lightgbm was installed as part of this project. 

The flight departures dataset will be used for this project. The goal is to predict if a flight departure is going to be delayed by 15 minutes based on the various attributes in our dataset.
